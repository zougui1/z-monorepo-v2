## Lore

humans want to eradicate dragons from the world.
in order for their plan to work, they use dark magic to control other species, such as orcs, goblins, etc... and also create monsters.
all with discretion so the dragons don't notice it.
but that was without counting for one of their experiments to go wrong. a dangerous monster was created but they couldn't control it, so it went on a rampage and destroyed a village. and that didn't go unnoticed by dragons.
